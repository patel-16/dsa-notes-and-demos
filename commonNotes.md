- Always good to play with small examples first as a warmup plus to strategize

- Mostly try to come up with the optimal algo by yourself only...but sometimes due to time constraints when 
studying the standard algo...don't just cram the algo....do better analysis of why the algo works and how the 
original idea could have been conceived...(sort of self - discovery, 3B1B)
